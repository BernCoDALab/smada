    "text": "Classroom conduct\nWe are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive learning environment for all students, regardless of their background, identity, physical appearance, or manner of communication. Any form of language or behavior used to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort will not be tolerated. This applies to all course participants (instructor, students, guests). In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment, we ask the following:\n\nPlease let us know if you have a name or set of preferred pronouns that you would like us to use\nPlease let us know if anyone in class says something that makes you feel uncomfortable[1]\n\nIn addition, we encourage the following kinds of behaviors:\n\nUse welcoming and inclusive language\nShow courtesy and respect towards others\nAcknowledge different viewpoints and experiences\nGracefully accept constructive criticism\n\nAlthough we strive to create and use inclusive materials in this course, there may be overt or covert biases in the course material due to the lens with which it was written. Your suggestions about how to improve the value of diversity in this course are encouraged and appreciated.\nPlease note: The University of Bern is committed to a non-discriminatory environment. This applies in particular to discrimination on the basis of gender (sexism) and sexual assaults (sexual harassment): we are all entitled to protection of our personal integrity at work and during our studies and to the respect of our limits. The University of Bern is also legally obliged to protect its members from sexual harassment. In particular, superiors are also responsible for looking out and reacting.\nIf you believe you have been a victim of any form of discrimination, you have the right to report it to the University.\n\n\n\nAccess & accommodations\nAll students deserve access to the full range of learning experiences, and we are committed to creating inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal and state laws. If you feel like your performance in class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please talk with us.\n\nDisabilities\nIf you have already established accommodations with Disability Resources for Students (DRS), please communicate your approved accommodations to us at your earliest convenience so we can discuss your needs in this course. If you have not yet established services through DRS, but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability that requires accommodations (e.g., mental health, learning, vision, hearing, physical impacts), you are welcome to contact DRS at 206-543-8924 or via email or their website. DRS offers resources and coordinates reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities and/or temporary health conditions. Reasonable accommodations are established through an interactive process between you, your instructor(s) and DRS.\n\n\nReligious observances\nStudents who expect to miss class or assignments as a consequence of their religious observance will be provided with a reasonable accommodation to fulfill their academic responsibilities. Absence from class for religious reasons does not relieve students from responsibility for the course work required during the period of absence. It is the responsibility of the student to provide the instructor with advance notice of the dates of religious holidays on which they will be absent. Students who are absent will be offered an opportunity to make up the work, without penalty, within a reasonable time, as long as the student has made prior arrangements.\n\n\n\nTechnology\nThis course will revolve around hands-on computing exercises that demonstrate the topics of interest. Therefore, students are strongly recommended to bring their own laptop to class, although students are certainly free to work with one another. For students without access to a personal laptop: Please let us know in time, and we will try to find a solution.\nAll of the software we will be using is free and platform independent, meaning students may use macOS, Linux, or Windows operating systems. In addition to a web browser, we will be using the free GIS software QGIS. The instructor will be available to help students troubleshoot any software installation problems.\n\n\nTeaching methodology\nThis course will introduce new material primarily through prepared slides and videos. What is learned is then applied under supervision. Students will be expected to work both individually and collaboratively during this time and also in general; course content and evaluation will emphasize the communication of ideas and the ability to think critically more so than a specific pathway or method. Other areas of this website provide an overview of the topics to be covered, including links to lecture materials, computer labs, and homework assignments.\n\n\nCommunication\nThis course will involve a lot of communication between and among students and the instructor. Short questions should be addressed to us via email; we will try my best to respond to your message within 24 hours. Under more normal circumstances, detailed questions would be addressed to us in person–either after class or during a scheduled meeting. In this case, however, we will schedule one-on-one or group video calls as needed.\n\n\nEvaluation\nThe exact terms of evaluation will be decided within the first week of the course. Here is what has been the rule for earlier courses in a similar setting:\nStudents will be evaluated on their knowledge of course content and their ability to communicate their understanding of the material via individual homework assignments (60%) and class participation (40%). There will be 12 homework assignments, each of which will count toward 5% of the final grade. Please note, all assignments must be turned in to achieve a passing grade.\n\nHomework (60%)\nThe “homework” is due by 17:59 on the following Tuesday. It will consist of some small tasks and practical approaches based on topics covered. There will be 12 assignments worth 5% each. Your learning in the class will be greatly enhanced by doing the “homework” which consist of applying the material you learn in each lecture to a data set.\n\n\nParticipation (40%)\nWe expect a certain amount of engagement from each student, which includes independently preparing the course content and attending and participating in the computer labs.\nStudents should discuss any potential schedule conflicts with the instructor during the first week of class.\n\n\n\n\nAcademic integrity\nFaculty and students at the University of Bern are expected to maintain the highest standards of academic conduct, professional honesty, and personal integrity. Plagiarism, cheating, and other academic misconduct are serious violations of the Scientific Code of Conduct. Students who have been guilty of a violation will receive zero points for the assignment in question.\n\n\nEvaluation by you\nWith the help of standardised student feedback, courses at the University of Bern are continuously reviewed and further developed. All teaching staff and all courses are regularly evaluated.\nIn due course at the end of the semester, you will be provided with a link that will allow you to evaluate the course. Please take this opportunity to help us improve our teaching and thus your learning success!\n\n\nMental health\nIf you should feel like you need some help, please consider the following resources available to students.\nIf you are experiencing a life-threatening emergency, please dial 112.\nCounseling Center Phone: 031 / 635 24 35\n\n\nEndnotes\n[1] If the instructor should be the one to say or do something that makes a student uncomfortable, the student should feel free to contact the Director of the Prehistoric Archaeology of Bern University.\n\nThis site was last updated at 12:15 on 03 Feb 2025"

    "text": "Statistics has become an indispensable tool in prehistoric archaeology. This course is intended on the one hand to give the participants the skills to understand and reproduce statistical analyses in literature and on the other hand to enable them to use such analyses for their scientific work themselves.\nBasic statistical concepts will be explained and simple uni- and bivariate methods of descriptive, explorative and inductive statistics will be presented. An important part is the practical application of these methods. This is to be carried out with the help of the statistics software R, a open source and free-of-charge, yet extremely powerful computing environment.\nThe course is suitable for students of all semesters; no statistical knowledge or expertise in special computer programs is required. It consists of lectures, practical exercises, and tutorials. Assessment will be based on practical assignments and a final exam (theoretical and/or practical).\nThe course will be taught in English.\n\nKey dates\nWill be made available soon.\n\n\nLearning objectives\nStudents are familiar with basic statistical procedures and can apply them to archaeological case studies. Furthermore, they are familiar with the basic usage of the statistics programme R.\n\n\nInstructors\n\n\n\n\n\nMartin Hinz\nSenior Researcher (Oberassistent), IAW Bern\nmartin.hinz@unibe.ch\n\n\n\n\nMeeting times & locations\n\nLectures\nTuesday from 12:15-14:00, Seminarraum 016, Mittelstrasse 43, 3012 Bern\nThe course will be held in presence. The teaching content is additionally provided by means of videos and other material. Students are encouraged to work on this independently and to deepen it if necessary. I will respond as quickly as possible to questions sent to me via email.\nYour own computer equipment is recommended. If you have any problems in this regard, please let me know in advance. We will work exclusively with free software, if possible with open source solutions.\n\n\nOffice hours\nto be announced\n\n\n\nPre-requisites\nNone except motivation and the desire to learn, as well as the readiness to work independently.\n\nThis site was last updated at 12:15 on 03 Feb 2025"
