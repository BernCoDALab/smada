    "text": "Statistics has become an indispensable tool in prehistoric archaeology. This course is intended on the one hand to give the participants the skills to understand and reproduce statistical analyses in literature and on the other hand to enable them to use such analyses for their scientific work themselves.\nBasic statistical concepts will be explained and simple uni- and bivariate methods of descriptive, explorative and inductive statistics will be presented. An important part is the practical application of these methods. This is to be carried out with the help of the statistics software R, a open source and free-of-charge, yet extremely powerful computing environment.\nThe course is suitable for students of all semesters; no statistical knowledge or expertise in special computer programs is required. It consists of lectures, practical exercises, and tutorials. Assessment will be based on practical assignments and a final exam (theoretical and/or practical).\nThe course will be taught in English.\n\nKey dates\n18.02.25 First Sitting 25.03.25 no class 22.04.25 no class 06.05.25 no class 20.05.25 no class 27.05.25 Test\n\n\nLearning objectives\nStudents are familiar with basic statistical procedures and can apply them to archaeological case studies. Furthermore, they are familiar with the basic usage of the statistics programme R.\n\n\nInstructors\n\n\n\n\n\nMartin Hinz\nSenior Researcher (Oberassistent), IAW Bern\nmartin.hinz@unibe.ch\n\n\n\n\nMeeting times & locations\n\nLectures\nTuesday from 12:15-14:00, Seminarraum 016, Mittelstrasse 43, 3012 Bern\nThe course will be held in presence. The teaching content is additionally provided by means of videos and other material. Students are encouraged to work on this independently and to deepen it if necessary. I will respond as quickly as possible to questions sent to me via email.\nYour own computer equipment is recommended. If you have any problems in this regard, please let me know in advance. We will work exclusively with free software, if possible with open source solutions.\n\n\nOffice hours\nto be announced\n\n\n\nPre-requisites\nNone except motivation and the desire to learn, as well as the readiness to work independently.\n\nThis site was last updated at 07:56 on 13 May 2025"

Absence from class for religious reasons does not relieve students from responsibility for the course work required during the period of absence. It is the responsibility of the student to provide the instructor with advance notice of the dates of religious holidays on which they will be absent. Students who are absent will be offered an opportunity to make up the work, without penalty, within a reasonable time, as long as the student has made prior arrangements."
